I'd rather be a lamppost in Harlem," writer Langston Hughes once mused, "than the mayor of Waycross, Ga."

More than half a century later, well after the demise of Jim Crow, Muhammad Ali was no less dismissive of the rural South: "The trouble with Atlanta," he said, "is that it's surrounded by Georgia."

It's no surprise that Ali's line became something of a mantra for the city's African Americans, both the native-born and the newly arrived. For them, the thought of venturing into the small towns, backwoods and burgs of Dixie seemed foolhardy, if not fraught with remembrance of shameful things past.

But with Black History Month upon us, it may be time to reflect anew on the South that lies beyond major cities such as Atlanta. After all, many of the folks who rode the A train to Harlem in the 1930s began their journeys in no-name Georgia towns like Pinpoint, Roberta and Eatonton. The sum of black talent that sprang from Georgia is prodigious: Alice Walker, John O. Killens, Jackie Robinson, Otis Redding, Henry McNeal Turner, Lena Horne, Clarence Thomas, Little Richard. And the list goes on.
